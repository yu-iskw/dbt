//! Query the project metadata through a real DuckDB **adapter**, rather than a raw ADBC connection.
//!
//! Checks first read the index via `dbt-index-core`'s `DuckDbViewsBackend`, which opens an ADBC
//! connection directly and so bypasses the adapter layer entirely. Two consequences: check
//! SQL cannot use `adapter.*` or any macro that dispatches on the adapter, and the driver it loads is
//! `Backend::DuckDBExtended` — the bespoke dbt-built DuckDB carrying internal extensions, the same
//! driver sidecar mode selects — rather than vanilla `Backend::DuckDB`.
//!
//! This module is the adapter-backed replacement. It builds a DuckDB adapter over an in-memory
//! database, registers the metadata as views, and executes check SQL through it.
//!
//! Three entry points, and they are not the same surface:
//!
//! - [`open_metadata_adapter`] — `target/private/metadata/`, for a parse-time check. The
//!   parse-safe views only: narrowed names, and columns that are final at parse.
//! - [`open_epoch_adapter`] — the same directory, whole published surface, for
//!   `dbt show --info`.
//! - [`open_info_schema_adapter`] — `target/info_schema/v<n>/`, whose files are already the
//!   published shape.
//!
//! Three properties were verified before writing this (see `adapter_index_spike` in `check_task`):
//! the adapter constructs with no profile or credentials; views registered by one call are still
//! visible to the next, despite DuckDB connections deliberately not being cached
//! (`guard.persist = adapter_type != AdapterType::DuckDB`); and vanilla DuckDB reads parquet, which
//! matters because the whole point of the extended driver is its extra extensions.
