//! Storage APIs for canonicalized dbt schemas and intermediate table data.
//!
//! The schema store centralizes how dbt Fusion persists and retrieves Arrow
//! schemas for every node that may participate in a run.  It understands which
//! schemas must always originate from remote sources (frontier nodes, deferred
//! models, cross-project references) and which ones may be hydrated from the
//! local compilation results (analyzed models).  By baking those guarantees into
//! the storage layer, we avoid accidental cross-run state bleed and ensure that
//! commands see a consistent view of the project.
//!
//! Schemas and data are persisted using the following canonical layout:
//!
//! ```text
//! target/
//!   ├── private/metadata/compile/schemas/{N}.parquet   ← compile-time schemas (no TTL)
//!   ├── private/metadata/warehouse/schemas/{N}.parquet ← warehouse-fetched schemas (TTL)
//!   └── data/...
//! ```
//!
//! The store is responsible for building these paths, canonicalizing the fully
//! qualified identifiers, and serializing schemas (with the original warehouse
//! schema embedded as metadata when available).  Consumers interact with the
//! store exclusively through the [`SchemaStoreTrait`], which is implemented by
//! both production and mock backends.
