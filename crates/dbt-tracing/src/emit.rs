//! A module for emitting structured events.
//!
//! This module provides API's used for all span/event creation based on
//! our tracing infrastructre. They wrap `tracing::event!`/`tracing::span!` macros
//! and add functionality to capture file/line information of the callsite
//! (rather than the macro invocation site) and also efficiently pass telemetry attributes
//! into the tracing pipeline via thread-local storage.

// Tracing's library built-in file/line detection is not based on panic module, and
// thus will always report the actual location of the macro call where it was invoke.
// We on the other hand, would like to use function, rather than macros to emit events
// and create spans to aide lsp/IDE's (and thus simplify debugging, refactoring etc.)
// To do that, we use functuns with `#[track_caller]` attribute that allow capturing
// file/line position of the callsite and then inject them as custom fields into
// tracing. Our data layer extracts these and prefers them over native location info
// privided by tracing, while still being compatible with direct tracing calls.
